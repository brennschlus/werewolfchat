Yes this is yet another end-to-end encryption chat app, however, with post quantum cryptography (the NTRU library) resistant encryption. 
Name for the application was chosen for the following: Schrodinger's cat is both dead and alive, therefor the cat is undead. 
If the cat is undead that means it is either a zombie or a vampire. 
Zombies are dumb and vampires are smart. 
Quantum computing hacking/cryptanalysis math is confusing at times, therefore it is probably to hard for a zombie. 
Therefore Schrodinger's cat is a vampire. What do vampires (and also cats) not like... 
A Werewolf. 
Thus the chat app that protects you from Vampire Hacker Cats with end to end post quantum encryption is Werewolf Chat.
