# werewolf-chat
Yet another end-to-end encryption chat app, however, with post quantum cryptography (the NTRU library) resistant encryption.  Name for the application was chosen for the following: Schrodinger's cat is both dead and alive, therefor the cat is undead. If the cat is undead that means it is either a zombie or a vampire. Zombies are dumb and vampires are smart. Quantum computing hacking/cryptanalysis math is confusing at times, therefore it is probably to hard for a zombie. Therefore Schrodinger's cat is a vampire. What do vampires (and also cats) not like.. A Werewolf. Thus the chat app that protects you from Vampire Hacker Cats with end to end post quantum encryption is Werewolf Chat.
